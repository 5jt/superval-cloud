Node Reverse Post
=================

Adapted from `node-reverse/` to accept file by HTTP POST and 

- [x] 1.0 reverse the file content string and return it as a TXT
- [x] 2.0 write the received file to the local filesystem as `input.txt` whence `reverse()` reads it, reverses it, and writes result to `output.txt`.
- [ ] 3.0 add WINE, `aplwr.exe` and `reverse.w3` to Docker image
